# Power BI Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio! This repository showcases my expertise in data visualization and analytics using Power BI. Each project demonstrates different aspects of my skills, including data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design.

## Projects

1. **[Sales Dashboard](./Sales_Dashboard/README.md)**  
   A dashboard showing comprehensive analysis of total lifetime sales, year-over-year sales percentage growth from 2010 to 2013, and sales trends. It includes an interactive drilldown feature for a salesperson dashboard, displaying cumulative sales by month and year-over-year performance. Additionally, the dashboard highlights top-selling regions, resellers, and products, offering detailed revenue insights through dynamic visualizations.
